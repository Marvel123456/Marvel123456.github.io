    <div class="boxes">
        There are approximately 30 million dogs and cats killed every year across Asia.
    </div>
    <div class="boxes">
        These dogs are killed brutally through drowing, electrocution, beating, suffocation, etc.
    </div>
    <div class="boxes">
        These dogs are kidnapped from owners on the streets by feeding them posioned/laced food and then trafficked to the slaughterhouses.
    </div>
    <div class="boxes">
        These dogs are bound in bags and muzzled so they are helpless and cannot defend themselves against their attackers.
    </div>
    <div class="boxes">
        The living conditions of these dogs until their cruel deaths are horrible.. They live amongst dead corpses of other dogs.. blood, waste..etc.

        "Latest opinion poll data commissioned by Humane World for Animals Viet Nam shows that 87% of people in the country have either experienced their pet being stolen or have an acquaintance who has had their pet stolen. Dog thieves, armed with machetes and tasers, are hired by dog butchers to supply dogs. "

        "Yes. Severe animal suffering is endemic to the dog meat trade. The animals are crammed by the hundreds onto the backs of trucks, packed so tightly in cages that they are unable to move. In Viet Nam, it is not uncommon for dogs to be violently force-fed with a tube down the throat in order to boost their weight before sending them to slaughter. <br><Br>

Dogs are typically driven for days or weeks, often sick and injured, and many die from suffocation, dehydration or heatstroke long before they reach their destination. Dogs on South Korean meat farms are kept locked in small, barren metal cages, left exposed to the elements and given just enough food, water or shelter to keep them alive. Humane World for Animals has uncovered appalling conditions where disease and mental distress are rampant, with many dogs showing obvious signs of sickness, depression, severe malnutrition and abnormal behavior. <Br><br>

All of these dogs will eventually end up at a slaughterhouse, market or restaurant. The method by which they are killed varies: in South Korea, the most common method for slaughtering a dog is by electrocution, but hanging and beating are also used. In China and Viet Nam, dogs are usually beaten to death with a metal pipe and then bled out from a cut to the throat or groin, but they can also be hanged, or—less commonly—thrown conscious into large drums of boiling water."
